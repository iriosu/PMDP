\section{Repository}

The repository Julia contains four main files:
\begin{itemize}
    \item HM.jl: implementation of the Hotelling model.
    \item LDM.jl: implementation of the general affine demand model.
    \item utilities.jl: contains a series of methods to compute demands, virtual costs, and check assumptions.
    \item exmaples.jl: tests solutions with close forms to contrast with the results from optimization.
\end{itemize}

In what follows I describe some details that are relevant in each file.

\section{HM.jl}
This file implements the Hotelling demand model. Given \(\Theta = \lrp{\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_m}\) and \(n\) suppliers, the structure of the variables
is
\[
x(\theta) = \lrc{x_1(\theta_1), \ldots, x_n(\theta_1), x_1(\theta_2), \ldots, x_n(\theta_2), \ldots, x_1(\theta_m), \ldots, x_n(\theta_m)}.
\]
The same holds for the other variables, i.e. \(t, p\), and also for the dual variables \(u\) and \(v\).

The formulation of the centralized problem follows directly from the paper, considering as objective function
\[
\max \E_{\theta}\lrc{\sum_{i=1}^n
-\frac{\delta}{2}\lrc{ \lrp{l_i-\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j(\theta)}^2 + \lrp{\sum_{j=1}^{i} x_j(\theta) - l_i}^2  } }
\]
In the case with two suppliers in the extremes of [0,1] this reduces to
\[
\max \E_{\theta}\lrc{
-\frac{\delta}{2}\lrc{ x_1(\theta)^2 + x_2(\theta)^2} - t_1(\theta) - t_2(\theta) }
\]
To implement the decentralized problem, we incorporate the KKT conditions as
additional constraints to the centralized problem. In the two-supplier case these are: for each \(\theta \in \Theta\) and \(i\in \lrl{1,2}\)
\[
\begin{split}
    p_i(\theta) + \delta x_i(\theta) - u_i(\theta) + v(\theta) &= 0 \\
    x_i(\theta)\cdot u_i(\theta) &= 0 \\
    u_i(\theta) & \geq 0 \\
    t_i(\theta) - x_i(\theta)\cdot p_i(\theta) &= 0
\end{split}
\]
Primal feasibility constraints are omitted because they are part of the centralized problem.

This file has the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item GenerateInputs: returns the matrices and vectors to construct the
    constraints and objective of the optimization problem. Some special elements
    of this method are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item line 12: generates the set of types \(\Theta\), i.e. all possible
        combinations of types of suppliers.
        \item line 27-34: represents computation of \(f_{-i}(\theta_{-i})\).
    \end{itemize}
    The outputs of this method are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item nsupp: number of suppliers
        \item ntypes: number of types for each supplier;
        \item nvars: length of each vector of variables, i.e. \(n\times m\)
        \item sts: number of scenarios, i.e. \(\lra{\Theta}\)
        \item bGx: matrix multiplying \(x\) in the inequality IC and IR constraints.
        This matrix is organized as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The first nsupp \(\times\) ntypes rows are IR constraints, ordered
            lexicographically by \((i, \theta_i)\) in increasing order, where \(i\) is the supplier
            and \(\theta_i\) is his type. For example, in a 2 supplier-2 types
            example, the first row corresponds to supplier 1 with low type, then
            supplier 1 with high type, then supplier 2 with low type, and
            finally supplier 2 with high type.
            \item The last nsupp \(\times\) ntypes \(\times\) (ntypes-1) rows correspond
            to IC constraints, ordered lexicographically by \((i, \theta_i, \theta_i')\) in
            increasing order.
        \end{itemize}
        \item bGt: matrix multiplying \(t\) in the inequality IC and IR constraints
        \item bh: right-hand side of IR-IC constraints (equal to a vector of zeros)
        \item bA: matrix multiplying \(x\) in the feasibility constraints
        \item bb: right-hand side of feasibility constraints (equal to a vector of ones)
        \item wqt: vector with the probabilities of each scenario in \(\Theta\) to compute the expected value for objective function
    \end{itemize}
    \item CheckFeasibility: receives the inputs of the problem and solutions
    \(x_0, t_0\) and checks whether this solution is feasible for the decentralized problem. To accomplish this, I fix \(x=x_0, t=t_0\) and solve the decentralized problem with objective value equal to 1.
    \item SolveOptimization: formulates and solves the optimization problem using as inputs the parameters of the problem and version, which is equal to centralized or decentralized.
    \item SimulateOptimization: solve recursively the optimization problem for different \(\delta\).
\end{itemize}


\section{LDM.jl}
This file implements the general affine linear demand model. The structure of the variables is equivalent to the previous case. The centralized problem
follows directly from the paper, while the decentralized problem is implemented
by adding the following KKT conditions as constraints (in matrix form):
\[
\begin{split}
    p(\theta) - c + Dx(\theta) - u(\theta) + v(\theta) &= 0 \\
    x(\theta)\cdot u(\theta) &= 0 \\
    u(\theta) & \geq 0 \\
    t(\theta) - x(\theta)\cdot p(\theta) &= 0
\end{split}
\]
The methods in this file are the same as in the previous case adapted to the general affine demand model.


\section{utilities.jl}
This file contains a series of methods that are used in the previous files.
These methods are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item combine and combwithrep: used to generate all potential profiles in \(\Theta\).
    \item ComputeCumulativeDistribution: for a given dictionary of marginal
    distributions, returns a disctionary of marginal cumulative distributions.
    \item virtualcost: computes, for a given supplier \(i\) and type \(\theta\), the virtual cost.
    \item demandLM: computes the demand faced by supplier \(i\) in the general
    affine model with two suppliers (obtained from close form solution).
    \item assortmentHM: returns the set of suppliers in the assortment of the
    Hotelling model for a given price and \(\delta\).
    \item demandHM: computes the demand faced by supplier \(i\) in the
    Hoteeling model with two suppliers.
    \item checkvcincreasing: checks whether the virtual costs are increasing
    for each supplier.
    \item checkconditionsHM: check whether the conditions in Theorem 4.1 are
    satisfied; returns a list with two booleans, one for each condition.
    \item checkconditionsLM: check whether the conditions in Theorem 5.2 are
    satisfied; returns a list with two booleans, one for each condition. To
    find \(d^*\), we use the following heuristic:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Divide \(\Theta\) in two subsets \(\Theta^S\) and \(\Theta^N\),
        such that
        \[
        \begin{split}
        \Theta^S &= \lrl{\theta \in \Theta: \; x_i(\theta) > 0, \; \forall i} \\
        \Theta^N &= \lrl{\theta \in \Theta: \; \exists i \; st.\;  x_i(\theta) = 0}
        \end{split}
        \]
        \item For each \(\theta \in \Theta^S\), compute
        \[
        d(\theta) = \max\lrl{\lra{v_i(\theta)-v_i(\theta')}: \theta' \in \Theta^N, \; i=1, \ldots, n}
        \]
        \item Define
        \[
        d^* = \min\lrl{d(\theta):\; \theta\in \Theta^S}
        \]
    \end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
